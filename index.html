        <div class="content">
            <p>Chairs are responsible for stimulating and coordinating debate, encouraging new delegates, and acting as role models. Professional and responsible behavior is fundamental; actions should not be based on personal opinions. Chairs must ensure a positive debate outcome and take initiative for a smooth session and delegate enjoyment. They should have a clear vision for the committee's outcome and plan accordingly, monitoring and revising as needed. If debate stalls, chairs should become more active by encouraging delegates, convening caucuses, drawing attention to new options, or making suggestions based on their knowledge.</p>

The Third Chair handles administrative tasks and equipment. Rotating roles is crucial for team success.</li>
                <li>Pick-Me/Do-Not-Pick-Me List: Used by the expert chair to track points and speeches, aid in selecting best delegate, random calls, and monitoring beginner delegates and amendments.

                <li>Direct Dialogue: Interrupt immediately and state, "There will be no direct dialogue between delegates.".</li>
                <li>Non-English Speaking: Remind delegates that English is the only working language.</li>
                <li>Declarations of War: Not in order; make this clear to the house without dwelling on it.</li>
                <li>Criticism of Chairs: Avoid emphatic reactions; remain calm and in control. Remind delegates to be constructive and relevant to the debate.</li>

        <button class="collapsible">Disruptive Delegates</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Start chairing strictly to establish authority. For disruptive delegates seeking attention, remain calm and in control. Chairs should react as a team to inappropriate conduct. Remove a delegate only if they are causing major disruption or most commotion. Report delegates to the executive team if necessary.</p>

        <h2>General Chairing Guide</h2>

        <button class="collapsible">Introduction</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Let's start with a definition from the official United Nations Model UN Guide: The Chair or Chairperson directs the discussions, makes sure that the rules are observed, accords the right to speak, puts forward questions, and announces decisions. The Chairperson has complete control of the proceedings at any meeting and has the responsibility of maintaining order at all times. Because the Chairperson represents the whole Committee, they cannot simultaneously represent one of the participating delegations. Chairpersons are expected to cease operating as a member of their national delegation as long as they are acting as Chairperson and do not vote. The Chairperson should speak and act impartially on behalf of the Committee as a whole and not seek to promote any national or personal views. You are not allowed to act based on your personal opinions, but you do have a big responsibility in ensuring a debate's positive outcome. Serving as chair gives you the opportunity to stimulate and co-ordinate a debate, to initiate and encourage new delegates to speak up for their countries and to act as a role model for them. Therefore, it is fundamental that you behave responsibly and professionally at all times. Also remember that the quality of your "background paper" (study guide for delegates) has a direct bearing on the quality of submitted resolutions and the debate. Aside from these characteristics, what matters most is your attitude: an approachable chair is someone who gives delegates confidence to speak and inspires them.</p>

            <p>Chairs are not tyrants or monarchs, but leaders: what kind of leader do you want to be?</p>

            <h4>Autocratic</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Useful in some circumstances</li>
                <li>Time-saving</li>
                <li>Involves good leadership skills and its outcome is highly dependent on the quality of the leading style</li>
                <li>Risks demotivating or alienating delegates</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Democratic</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Improves collective decision-making (but sometimes creates delays)</li>
                <li>Carries on consultations with all stakeholders to help motivating them</li>
                <li>Makes delegates feel like they have a real stake in the final outcome and encourages them to take ownership of the process</li>
                <li>Encourages the sharing of ideas</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Laissez-Faire</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Responsibility shared by all</li>
                <li>Useful where creativity is important</li>
                <li>Highly motivating, as it gives people control over the project</li>
                <li>Relies on good teamwork and interpersonal relations</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <button class="collapsible">Position (Do's and Don'ts)</button>
        <div class="content">
            <h4>Always:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Carefully listen to the speeches of delegates to check that they stay on point, within an acceptable timeframe, and that they are not repetitive;</li>
                <li>Show respect to delegates and remember to thank the admin staff at the end of every conference day;</li>
                <li>Congratulate good speakers, particularly shy delegates and first-timers who clearly made an effort to take the spotlight by sending them written notes;</li>
                <li>Explain why you are implementing a certain decision;</li>
                <li>Feel the audience's pulse: if your committee seems bored or running out of ideas, consider allowing delegates some time for unmoderated caucus or a break, or to move directly into voting procedures;</li>
                <li>Keep noise levels in check: call the House to order as often as needed, but stop note passing only if necessary;</li>
                <li>Get to know your delegates and be approachable! Before starting your first committee session, introduce yourself: briefly talk about your experiences as staff, delegate, chair...</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Never:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Favour one delegate over another: give equal opportunities to speak to everyone and adopt a consistent policy towards all delegates;</li>
                <li>Take arbitrary procedural decisions;</li>
                <li>Publicly contradict a co-chair: to maintain control, you must be united and stand up for each other. Contradicting your co-chair in front of the House is rude and undermining, so, if you feel your colleagues have done something wrong, you may discreetly call their attention to it and talk about it afterwards;</li>
                <li>Shout at the House or at a delegate: always remain calm and collected; do not lose your temper, but warn them of consequences that may arise from disrespectful behaviour;</li>
                <li>Expect there to be complete silence; only call the House out if the noise is bothering the speaker;</li>
                <li>Suspend note passing, unless it is the source of commotion;</li>
                <li>Ignore a point or dismiss a question or remark: even when a point is inappropriate or useless, respond to it by correcting the delegate and swiftly move on with the debate. Remember that by ignoring or dismissing comments, you are not fulfilling your role as mentor;</li>
                <li>Abuse your authority: you will only come off as arrogant and will alienate delegates, instead of imposing a respectful attitude;</li>
                <li>Laugh at a delegate;</li>
                <li>Rush: speak slowly and articulate clearly;</li>
                <li>Interrupt a delegate: you may do so only to invite them to get to their closing remarks if the speech is inappropriate, off-topic, or simply too long;</li>
                <li>Look bored or as if you had nothing to do.</li>

                <li>MUN is about finding constructive and creative solutions to important issues.</li>
                <li>It is not about producing real, actionable resolutions (it is not called "model" for nothing).</li>
                <li>A good working knowledge of the UN system is necessary, but you do not need to know absolutely everything.</li>
                <li>If two or more delegates are disruptively conflicting on any one clause's practical feasibility, it is just a clash of egos. Remind them of who is in control by deciding for the solution that seems best to you and move the debate forward without feeling the need to give too many explanations.</li>
